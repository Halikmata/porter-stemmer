Who is Thomas Jefferson?,thoma jefferson april 13 1743 a juli 4 1826 wa an american statesman diplomat lawyer architect philosoph and foun father who ser a the third presid of the unite state from 1801 to 1809 13 among the committe of five char by the second contin congres with author the declar of independ jefferson wa the declar  primari author follow the american revolutionari war and prior to becom the nation  third presid in 1801 jefferson wa the first unite state secretari of state under georg washington and then the nation  second vice presid under john adam,"Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743[a] – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809.[13] Among the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was the Declaration's primary author. Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming the nation's third president in 1801, Jefferson was the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams.

Among the nation's Founding Fathers, Jefferson is considered unmatched in his intellectual depth and breadth.[14] His passionate writings and advocacy for human rights, including freedom of thought, speech, and religion, were a leading inspiration behind the American Revolution, which ultimately gave rise to the American Revolutionary War, American independence, and the United States Constitution. Jefferson's ideas were globally influential in shaping and inspiring the Age of Enlightenment, which proved transformational in the late 17th and 18th centuries.[15] He was a leading proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, and produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels.

During the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia in the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. As a Virginia legislator, he drafted a state law for religious freedom. He served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the Revolutionary War. In 1785, Jefferson was appointed the United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's first secretary of state under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts.

Jefferson and Federalist John Adams became friends as well as political rivals, serving in the Continental Congress and drafting the Declaration of Independence together. In the 1796 presidential election between the two, Jefferson came in second, which according to electoral procedure at the time, made him vice president to Adams. Jefferson challenged Adams again in 1800 and won the presidency. After his term in office, Jefferson eventually reconciled with Adams and they shared a correspondence that lasted 14 years. He and Adams both died on the same day, July 4, 1826, which was also the 50th anniversary of Declaration of Independence.

As president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. Starting in 1803, he promoted a western expansionist policy with the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the nation's claimed land area. To make room for settlement, Jefferson began the process of Indian tribal removal from the newly acquired territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was re-elected in 1804, but his second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act in response to British threats to U.S. shipping. The same year, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.

Jefferson was a plantation owner, lawyer, and politician, and mastered many disciplines including surveying, mathematics, horticulture, and mechanics. He was also an architect in the Palladian tradition. Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his appointment as president of the American Philosophical Society. He largely shunned organized religion but was influenced by Christianity, Epicureanism,[4] and deism. Jefferson rejected fundamental Christianity, denying Christ's divinity. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people, including Edward Carrington, John Taylor of Caroline, and James Madison. In 1785, Jefferson authored Notes on the State of Virginia, considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800.[16] Jefferson championed the ideals, values, and teachings of the Enlightenment.

Since the 1790s, Jefferson was rumored to have had children by his sister-in-law and slave Sally Hemings, leading to what is known as the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. A 1998 DNA test concluded that one of Sally Hemings's children, Eston Hemings, was of the Jefferson male line. According to scholarly consensus, based on documentary and statistical evaluation, as well as oral history, Jefferson probably fathered at least six children with Hemings, including four that survived to adulthood.[17][18][19]

After retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia, his peaceful acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France without war or controversy, and his ambitious and successful Lewis and Clark Expedition. Some modern historians are critical of Jefferson's personal involvement with slavery. Jefferson is consistently ranked among the top ten presidents of American history.",information_extraction

For example, Microsoft has seen great popularity due to popular title Halo being exclusively available on the console.  On the other hand, Playstation has popular exclusive titles such as God of War and Gran Turismo.

what is REST API,,"REST API is an architectural style for building network APIs. In practice, most REST APIs are using JSON over HTTP. REST APIs have several properties that make them very popular.

HTTP is the foundational and the most popular network protocol across the internet. By using HTTP, REST APIs can fully utilize the internet infrastructure, which greatly reduce the complexity and operational costs. For example, using HTTPS for transport security, and using URL for request routing.

JSON is a simple, stable, and intuitive data format , which is not expected to change ever. This offers great ease of use and stability to REST APIs. For high performance applications, binary formats can be used instead, such as protobuf or thrift.

REST APIs are often designed as CRUD APIs, where API operations are commonly expressed as Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations on resources. CRUD operations are naturally mapped to HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE), and API resources can be naturally identified using URLs.",general_qa
What is underwriting?,,"Underwriting (UW) services are provided by some large financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies and investment houses, whereby they guarantee payment in case of damage or financial loss and accept the financial risk for liability arising from such guarantee.

The person or institution that agrees to sell a minimum number of securities of the company for commission is called the underwriter.

The term ""underwriting"" derives from the Lloyd's of London insurance market.

"Who are ''The Lumières"" ?",,"The Lumières (literally in English: The Lights) was a cultural, philosophical, literary and intellectual movement beginning in the second half of the 17th century, originating in western Europe and spreading throughout the rest of Europe. It included philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, David Hume, John Locke, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Pierre Bayle and Isaac Newton. This movement is influenced by the scientific revolution in southern Europe arising directly from the Italian renaissance with people like Galileo Galilei. Over time it came to mean the Siècle des Lumières, in English the Age of Enlightenment.[Note 1]

Members of the movement saw themselves as a progressive élite, and battled against religious and political persecution, fighting against what they saw as the irrationality, arbitrariness, obscurantism and superstition of the previous centuries. They redefined the study of knowledge to fit the ethics and aesthetics of their time. Their works had great influence at the end of the 18th century, in the American Declaration of Independence and the French Revolution.[1]

This intellectual and cultural renewal by the Lumières movement was, in its strictest sense, limited to Europe. These ideas were well understood in Europe, but beyond France the idea of ""enlightenment"" had generally meant a light from outside, whereas in France it meant a light coming from within oneself.

In the most general terms, in science and philosophy, the Enlightenment aimed for the triumph of reason over faith and belief; in politics and economics, the triumph of the bourgeois over nobility and clergy.",open_qa

A United Nations report of 2016 did not endorse a specific reparations proposal, but did call out that there is an ideology of white supremacy present in the population of the United States that inhibits social cohesion.  Further arguments have been made identifying slavery as a cause of mass incarcerations, poverty and other ills that affect today’s African Americans.
It could be argued that there is an inherent acknowledgement that the case exists to examine the impact of slavery on the social, political and economic life of the United States in the annual submission to Congress of the ""Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act”.  There are also individual cities within the USA which have instituted reparations.  Estimates of the cost to African Americans of the United States’ history of discrimination have been estimated variously at $1.4 trillion, $4.7 trillion, $5.7 trillion, $14.2 trillion and $17.1 trillion.  These estimates express the projected cost in $ to restore the black community to the economic position it would have if it had not been subjected to slavery and discrimination.",summarization

Did dinosaurs have lips?,,"Recent research suggests that the popular perception that dinosaurs had exposed teeth may be incorrect, and the current hypothesis is that the Tyrannosaurus rex did indeed have lips. A 2023 study by Dr Mark Witton of the University of Portsmouth said popular depictions of dinosaurs in movies like Jurassic Park are out of date. The study examined a large tooth that had spent over 500 days in the mouth of a Tyrannosaurus rex with no evidence of substantial wear, which is consistent with all findings of teeth found in the theropod family of dinosaurs. When contrasted with alligators and crocodiles, who have no lips and have more easily damaged teeth the theory says the evidence points to theropods, including Tyrannosaurus rex did indeed have lips. There would have been expected to be wear on the thin enamel on the teeth far more consistent with modern animals like crocodiles if dinosaurs had no lips.",general_qa

What is enriched air and why would divers dive with enriched air?,,"Enriched air, also known as nitrox, is one kind of air with more than 21% oxygen. 21% oxygen is the normal air we breathe on the earth. The primary benefit of using enriched air is to extend the diver's bottom time, and reduce the need to push to no decompression limit. This advantage is really beneficial in deeper diving. 
For example, at 80 feet of depth, normal air can last around 30 min, while enriched air of 32% oxygen can last for 45 min and 36% can last for 55 min. 
While enriched air is really beneficial in extending bottom time, it is important that divers get trained to use it before diving with enriched air.",general_qa

This hunting instinct is completely normal, and it isn't fair to the cat to try to train it not to attack birds, as it is simply in its nature to do so. However, letting a cat hunt your pet bird is similarly not humane, as it will be very stressful to the bird and could lead to the bird being injured. Larger birds are also not a good idea, as the bird could cause injury to the cat if the cat tries to attack it. Overall, it just isn't a good idea to have both cats and birds, since they tend not to coexist well, and pet owners should just pick one species to have.",creative_writing

Is beauty objective or subjective?,,"The opinions on this question vary from person to person. 
Statistically, a pattern of preference is easily visible on what people would describe as beautiful. An evident example of this phenomenon is a beauty standard for women and men. Society seems to agree on what features, both physical and internal, can deem a person beautiful. The standard of beauty is also projected beyond humans, onto animal breeds, for example, in cat shows. 
A link between beauty and how closely it resembles perfection appears to exist. For example, a rose with many petals and no tears or scratches is generally seen as more beautiful than one with fewer, visibly ruined petals. 
However, the question of perfection also raises a problem as it is difficult and arguably impossible to define perfection. Beauty does not necessarily mean perfection. For example, large eyes are statistically considered to be more attractive however, in terms of their biological  purpose they possess no superiority to small eyes. Therefore, both beauty and perfection depend on the perspective or purpose with which you observe an object.

Furthermore, the clear fluctuations through centuries and cultures on what is considered to be beautiful should also be taken into account. Fashion trends and art styles, for instance,  are constantly changing. Additionally, the diversity in opinions suggests there is nothing that is considered beautiful by everyone, so even if the majority deem a particular object or thing as beautiful, it’s beauty remains subjective because it remains based on an ever-changing preference rather than objective truth.",general_qa

Give me five ways in which I can make my homebrew beer more interesting,,"There are infinite ways to create interesting flavours, that are either personal favourites or attempt to replicate classic beers and beer styles. There are a number of factors that make up a beers flavour profile and part of the enjoyment brewing your own beer at home, is that you can play around with each of these to change the flavour and character of your homebrew beer. Here are five ways in which you can change your own homebrew recipe to add interesting flavours or alternatively you can alter an existing homebrew recipe shared by somebody else or a brewery.

1. Use different hops
There is a huge variety of hops available to homebrewers and each of these can introduce its own particular flavour and aroma to your beer, ranging from pineapple and apricots, to pine trees and woods, to grapefruit pith and lemon zest. By using a different hop in your recipe either from the same family or from an entirely different family of hops, you can easily add interesting and often radical changes to the flavour profile of your beer. However, depending on when the hops are added in the brewing process, you can also increase/decrease the levels of bitterness of your beer, due to different hop varieties having different levels of alpha acids.

2. Use a different yeast
Besides fermenting the beer, yeast leave behind lots of interesting flavours and can give your homebrew it's own subtle character. For example, English yeast strains can add malty and sweet flavours, California yeast tends to create a clean and crisp beer, whilst saison yeast adds bright and fruity flavours to your beer.

3. Use different grains
Changing the amount of base malts can increase or decrease the alcohol in your finished beer. Trying swapping one base malt for another, like American pale malts for a British variety, and look for the subtle differences between them. You can also play around with the specialty grains, like using a slightly darker roast.

4. Add fruit, spices or herbs
Fruits, spices, herbs, and other ingredients are a great way to add an entirely personal character to your homebrew. Anything from fresh strawberries and basil to vanilla beans and cardamom can really complement the other malty, hoppy flavours in a beer. 

5. Alter your water profile
Different beer styles will typically be best achieved with a suitable water profile, with different levels of minerals to achieve the desired flavour profile. By adjusting the amounts of specific minerals found in your brewing water, beer can be made to taste fuller bodied, sweeter, drier, more bitter, or even sour.",brainstorming

Performances by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra were recorded in 1931 and 1932 using telephone lines between the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and the Bell labs in New Jersey. Some multitrack recordings were made on optical sound film, which led to new advances used primarily by MGM (as early as 1937) and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (as early as 1941). RCA Victor began recording performances by several orchestras using optical sound around 1941, resulting in higher-fidelity masters for 78-rpm discs. During the 1930s, Avery Fisher, an amateur violinist, began experimenting with audio design and acoustics. He wanted to make a radio that would sound like he was listening to a live orchestra—that would achieve high fidelity to the original sound. After World War II, Harry F. Olson conducted an experiment whereby test subjects listened to a live orchestra through a hidden variable acoustic filter. The results proved that listeners preferred high-fidelity reproduction, once the noise and distortion introduced by early sound equipment was removed.[citation needed]

Beginning in 1948, several innovations created the conditions that made major improvements of home-audio quality possible:

Reel-to-reel audio tape recording, based on technology taken from Germany after WWII, helped musical artists such as Bing Crosby make and distribute recordings with better fidelity.
The advent of the 33⅓ rpm Long Play (LP) microgroove vinyl record, with lower surface noise and quantitatively specified equalization curves as well as noise-reduction and dynamic range systems. Classical music fans, who were opinion leaders in the audio market, quickly adopted LPs because, unlike with older records, most classical works would fit on a single LP.
Higher quality turntables, with more responsive needles
FM radio, with wider audio bandwidth and less susceptibility to signal interference and fading than AM radio.
Better amplifier designs, with more attention to frequency response and much higher power output capability, reproducing audio without perceptible distortion.[3]
New loudspeaker designs, including acoustic suspension, developed by Edgar Villchur and Henry Kloss with improved bass frequency response.
In the 1950s, audio manufacturers employed the phrase high fidelity as a marketing term to describe records and equipment intended to provide faithful sound reproduction. Many consumers found the difference in quality compared to the then-standard AM radios and 78-rpm records readily apparent and bought high-fidelity phonographs and 33⅓ LPs such as RCA's New Orthophonics and London's FFRR (Full Frequency Range Recording, a UK Decca system). Audiophiles paid attention to technical characteristics and bought individual components, such as separate turntables, radio tuners, preamplifiers, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Some enthusiasts even assembled their own loudspeaker systems. With the advent of integrated multi-speaker console systems in the 1950s, hi-fi became a generic term for home sound equipment, to some extent displacing phonograph and record player.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the development of stereophonic equipment and recordings led to the next wave of home-audio improvement, and in common parlance stereo displaced hi-fi. Records were now played on a stereo. In the world of the audiophile, however, the concept of high fidelity continued to refer to the goal of highly accurate sound reproduction and to the technological resources available for approaching that goal. This period is regarded as the ""Golden Age of Hi-Fi"", when vacuum tube equipment manufacturers of the time produced many models considered superior by modern audiophiles, and just before solid state (transistorized) equipment was introduced to the market, subsequently replacing tube equipment as the mainstream technology.

In the 1960s, the FTC with the help of the audio manufacturers came up with a definition to identify high fidelity equipment so that the manufacturers could clearly state if they meet the requirements and reduce misleading advertisements.[4]

The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) was adapted into a power MOSFET for audio by Jun-ichi Nishizawa at Tohoku University in 1974. Power MOSFETs were soon manufactured by Yamaha for their hi-fi audio amplifiers. JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Sony and Toshiba also began manufacturing amplifiers with power MOSFETs in 1974.[5] In 1977, Hitachi introduced the LDMOS (lateral diffused MOS), a type of power MOSFET. Hitachi was the only LDMOS manufacturer between 1977 and 1983, during which time LDMOS was used in audio power amplifiers from manufacturers such as HH Electronics (V-series) and Ashly Audio, and were used for music and public address systems.[5] Class-D amplifiers became successful in the mid-1980s when low-cost, fast-switching MOSFETs were made available.[6] Many transistor amps use MOSFET devices in their power sections, because their distortion curve is more tube-like.[7]

A popular type of system for reproducing music beginning in the 1970s was the integrated music centre—which combined a phonograph turntable, AM-FM radio tuner, tape player, preamplifier, and power amplifier in one package, often sold with its own separate, detachable or integrated speakers. These systems advertised their simplicity. The consumer did not have to select and assemble individual components or be familiar with impedance and power ratings. Purists generally avoid referring to these systems as high fidelity, though some are capable of very good quality sound reproduction.

Audiophiles in the 1970s and 1980s preferred to buy each component separately. That way, they could choose models of each component with the specifications that they desired. In the 1980s, a number of audiophile magazines became available, offering reviews of components and articles on how to choose and test speakers, amplifiers, and other components.

Listening tests
See also: Codec listening test
Listening tests are used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile magazines, and audio engineering researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done in such a way that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid-state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgment. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use blind tests, in which listeners cannot see the components being tested. A commonly used variant of this test is the ABX test. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample A, the reference, and sample B, an alternative), and one unknown sample X, for three samples total. X is randomly selected from A and B, and the subject identifies X as being either A or B. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is transparent,[8] a properly conducted double-blind test can prove that a method is not transparent.

Blind tests are sometimes used as part of attempts to ascertain whether certain audio components (such as expensive, exotic cables) have any subjectively perceivable effect on sound quality. Data gleaned from these blind tests is not accepted by some audiophile magazines such as Stereophile and The Absolute Sound in their evaluations of audio equipment. John Atkinson, current editor of Stereophile, stated that he once purchased a solid-state amplifier, the Quad 405, in 1978 after seeing the results from blind tests, but came to realize months later that ""the magic was gone"" until he replaced it with a tube amp.[9] Robert Harley of The Absolute Sound wrote, in 2008, that: ""...blind listening tests fundamentally distort the listening process and are worthless in determining the audibility of a certain phenomenon.""[10]

Doug Schneider, editor of the online Soundstage network, refuted this position with two editorials in 2009.[11][12] He stated: ""Blind tests are at the core of the decades' worth of research into loudspeaker design done at Canada's National Research Council (NRC). The NRC researchers knew that for their result to be credible within the scientific community and to have the most meaningful results, they had to eliminate bias, and blind testing was the only way to do so."" Many Canadian companies such as Axiom, Energy, Mirage, Paradigm, PSB, and Revel use blind testing extensively in designing their loudspeakers. Audio professional Dr. Sean Olive of Harman International shares this view.[13]",information_extraction

With her brother-in-law out of town, Lisa had agreed to watch her niece Stella for the afternoon and the little girl was known to be a bit of a handful. Her plan had been to spend the afternoon at the park to let Stella run and climb, to wear her out a bit.  Unfortunately, this outing was foiled by the constant downpour of rain so Lisa resigned herself to a day inside with the tiny tyrant. Stella arrived early and excited to play.  Lisa decided to begin with a game of hide and seek, after all this could take up a good part of the morning without too much trouble.  Stella ran off to hide and Lisa sat quietly drinking coffee while calling out to the little girl, pretending to seek. Eventually she set off to find the little girl but soon she realized that something was wrong.  No matter where she looked, Stella was nowhere to be found. The house wasn't that large, making her disappearance even more perplexing.  Lisa had only recently moved into the home that she bought from her great aunt shortly before her death and she hasn't even moved out all of the existing furniture. Maybe Stella had gotten stuck somewhere behind the large wardrobe in the bedroom or she had climbed up into a cupboard in the laundry room.  Panic was starting to settle in as she moved the wardrobe further from the wall, where only a small child could have hidden before.  Suddenly, saw a small crack in the wall, and then realized it was a small door that she never knew was there.  The door was slightly ajar and she eventually moved the wardrobe enough to open the door and climb inside. What was this place?  The entrance opened up to reveal a small room that Lisa never knew existed!  It was full of treasure, gold bars and jewels.  Stella sat in the middle of the room quietly playing with the treasure, unaware of the immense value she was surrounded by.  Lisa had known her aunt was a secretive woman but this was an incredible find and would change her life forever.  Stella's visit was the good luck charm she needed to unlock this bounty and she would be forever grateful to the little girl!

How much music theory knowledge is required to compose music?,,"Technically speaking, very little music theory knowledge is “required” to compose music. Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. 

When you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you’ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that’s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don’t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.

So, that’s my answer. Learn at least as much theory as you need to know to understand the rules you want to break.",general_qa

How do you operate a car with a manual transmission?,,"Through a combination of a shifter and three pedals: gas, brake, and clutch. Press down the clutch pedal with one foot, and the brake with your other foot first and then turn on the engine of the car. It is recommended to shift to neutral immediately after turning on your car and prior to departing. To shift between one of the engaged gears, typically marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 N (for neutral) and R (for reverse), press down on the clutch all the way to the floor and move the shifter to the desired location. Once the car is on and you're in neutral if you want to move forward, press and hold the clutch pedal to the floor and move the shifter to the ""1"" position. Slowly disengage the clutch pedal partially, and while disengaging slowly start to press down on the gas pedal. After gradually pressing more on the gas pedal, slowly remove your foot from the clutch entirely. This will start you in forward motion, and you will be restricted to the speed limit of 1st gear. You can track this limit through the RPM (revolutions per minute) gauge on the dashboard of your car. Typically you want to keep the RPMs between 1500-4000. If the RPMs start to decrease to 1500-2000 that is a sign you want to shift from a higher gear to a lower gear (i.e. 2nd gear to 1st gear), and as the RPMs increase to 4000, that is an indication you want to shift to a higher gear (i.e. 2nd gear to 3rd gear).",general_qa

Why are so many US Hollywood films made in the state of Georgia?,,"While film in the United States as an audience artform started in New York it moved to Los Angeles for the stated reason of longer and sunnier days.  Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  

This mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.

So then why Georgia?  Georgia currently provides one of the highest incentive structures at 20% with minimal restrictions on talent and a very low minimum budget of $500,000.",open_qa

write a short essay on California wild fire,,"California is known for its hot, dry summers, which increase the risk of wildfires. Every year, the state experiences dozens of fires, which can be devastating to both the environment and people's homes and businesses.

In recent years, California has seen some of the worst wildfires in its history, with tens of thousands of acres of land destroyed and hundreds of homes lost. These fires are often started by a combination of high temperatures, dry conditions, and strong winds, which can quickly spread flames and make them difficult to control.

The effects of these fires are felt not just by those directly impacted, but by everyone in the state. Smoke and ash from the fires can cause respiratory problems and other health issues, and the destruction of habitats can harm wildlife populations and disrupt entire ecosystems.

Despite the challenges, California has made significant progress in fighting wildfires in recent years. The state has invested in new technologies and equipment to help firefighters respond more quickly and effectively to fires, and has increased efforts to prevent fires from starting in the first place.

While wildfires will likely always be a risk in California, the state's proactive approach to managing them gives hope that we can continue to protect people, wildlife, and the environment from their devastating effects.",creative_writing

Wat id DNA annotation?,,"DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome and determining what those genes do. An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it. Genes in a eukaryotic genome can be annotated using various annotation tools such as FINDER. A modern annotation pipeline can support a user-friendly web interface and software containerization such as MOSGA. Modern annotation pipelines for prokaryotic genomes are Bakta, Prokka and PGAP.

For DNA annotation, a previously unknown sequence representation of genetic material is enriched with information relating genomic position to intron-exon boundaries, regulatory sequences, repeats, gene names and protein products. This annotation is stored in genomic databases such as Mouse Genome Informatics, FlyBase, and WormBase. Educational materials on some aspects of biological annotation from the 2006 Gene Ontology annotation camp and similar events are available at the Gene Ontology website.

The National Center for Biomedical Ontology develops tools for automated annotation of database records based on the textual descriptions of those records.

As a general method, dcGO has an automated procedure for statistically inferring associations between ontology terms and protein domains or combinations of domains from the existing gene/protein-level annotations.",open_qa

"As a golfer, how can I fix my slice?",,"A common swing fault in golfers is a slice which is caused when the face of the club isn't aligned properly to the swing path of the club.  What will typically happen is at the time of impact, the face is open in relation to the target (ie aimed to the right if you are a right handed golfer) and the swing path is closed in relation to the target (ie aimed to the left if you are a left handed golfer).  When there is a large difference between the path of the swing and the face of the club, the impact will generate a high degree of lateral spin on the ball causing the flight of the ball to curve away from the target.  Here are some ways to fix this swing fault:

1. Grip the club with a stronger grip.  This means the v formed between your thumb and pointer finger on back hand is pointed to your rear shoulder and your opposite hand it also gripping the club more from the back.  This will help you close the face of the club at impact.
2. Focus on keeping the face closed in the backswing.  One fault many amateurs have is the club face opens toward the sky on the backswing too far meaning that the face will need to turn more on the downswing to get to square at impact.  Creating less rotation on the backswing can help with this.  
3. Keeping hips down and back in the downswing.  One fault that can cause inconsistent contact as well as a slice is when the hips thrust forward during the downswing causing the golfer to lift up to counter being too close to the ball which can often cause an over the top, out-to-in swing path.  Try to keep the hips back through the swing and focus on rotating the body to keep forward or lateral movement to a minimum.  

A slice is a very common issue among golfers but knowing the causes and swing faults that lead to a slice can help you think about how you can improve your swing to fix it.",general_qa

"What is more important in society, freedom or safety?",,"In our society, freedom and safety are both valued. While many other countries may put safety first, the harsh reality for Americans is that freedom always comes before safety. Despite being equally important, Americans foolishly put their trust in freedom over safety, without realizing the dangers of those freedoms.
The 2nd Amendment is a commonly danger to freedom. Americans are allowed to own guns for self protection. However, since the 18th century, guns have changed. Instead of a rifle or shotgun, Americans own ARI5s and other guns that can fire hundreds of bullets per round. Security in America has also increased leaving people to question the need for a personal weapon.
Often a result of having the freedom to easily buy and keep guns is school shootings. Teens who are depressed, lonely, suicidal, or crazy can easily buy or ise their parents guns to shoot and will other students, teachers, or themselves. In late 2022, a six year old brought his father's hand gun to school and shot his teacher. Yes, the gun was licensed and own by the father but why should any US citizen or even person feel safe in this country when the 2nd Amendment exsits? Should anyone trust their freedoms when it is easier to buy a gun than a car?
On the flip side, America's freedom is a gift that many other countries don't give. In 2019 when covid-19 first immerged in China, the country. went on lockdown, and in some cities, still remains so. By the third year of the pandemic, Americans learned of the extreme measures the Chinese government had taken upon its citizens, arresting those who left their homes for any reason, in the worst case. While China's laid protocols were way too extreme, Americans over the pandemic chose their freedom to not wear a mask over the safety of themselves and others, again.
To be clear, freedom and safety are not opposites, and countries who manage both well are impressive to be sure. But Americans are unwilling, to a dangerous level, to let go of some or any of their freedoms, even if it will benefit the overall safety of America. Freedom, in America, is valued above all, and could arguably be our most identifiable trait.",creative_writing

"Explain how new technologies, like LLMs and ChatGPT, may revolutionize Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in the future. Provide an example of how these APIs might work.",,"As a kid, I loved watching the Jetsons. As I grew older and ended up writing software and creating & implementing architectures for systems, I thought I would never see the day when a Jetsons-like kitchen would be feasible.
GPT (ChatGPT, etc.) has changed my mind.

Contractual Obligations
As an architect, you kind of need to think like a lawyer. You define contracts (APIs) between systems or components. You monitor those APIs for abuse or misuse.

I would use Swagger editor to define those contracts, and I would write the APIs to match interactions implied in mock-ups. I would vet the design with the team, I would walk through scenarios to see if the API would fit the use case and would not introduce performance bottlenecks, and I would simulate and automate as much as I could along the journey.

I was very careful to get it right the first time. It was never perfect the first time, of course. So, I also had to consider how the API could evolve while minimizing costs/impact to the rest of the system. The API, once deployed, would become something I would guard, like an honest politician guards the #usconstitution. The team had to be careful with any change that impacted the API.

API Mesh... More like API mess!
APIs rely on APIs which rely on more APIs and libraries. Once a system gets large enough, that complexity becomes a bottleneck. Small changes can have a huge ripple effect. Some approaches (like federated #GraphQL) help manage this complexity nicely. But it still involves an API under which there can exist a lot of fragility. #Agile or not, developing a complicated web of APIs is complex, requires specialized skills, and is full of unforeseen challenges.

The Kitchen Conversation, ChatGPT-style
The Jetsons' kitchen involves a number of systems, each composed of various parts, sensors, hardware, inputs and outputs. Considering the complexity of interactions between independent systems in a kitchen, the fact that the Jetsons' kitchen components would come from various vendors or manufacturers, traditional API design would not be able to fulfill the vision. Not practical, at all.

Now, let's think about APIs and the Jetsons' kitchen, #chatgpt -style.

Let's keep it simple: pizza. You (or your robot) make a pizza from scratch.

The oven asks the refrigerator: ""I see we have a pizza. Can you tell me if this is low-moisture mozzarella?""

Refrigerator: ""That's not even mozzarella. This pizza must have Muenster cheese as that is all I had in me. And the human removed some of the contents 30 minutes ago, so the probability of Muenster cheese on that pizza is quite high.""

A sensor from the kitchen who has eyes across the room chimes in at this point. Sensor: ""Beware that the crust of this pizza is made of cauliflower. I agree with the video sensor's assessment regarding the type of cheese. No new cheese entered the kitchen recently.""

Oven: ""Anything else I should know?""

Sensor: ""The temperature of the dough is 47F. This is cooler than the expert chef consensus of using room-temperature dough.""

Oven: ""Great. I know what to do. Since the dough is cool, I will start cooking with a temperature a little lower than the recipe specifies. Then I will increase the temp of bottom element so as to provide a nice crisp crust. I will keep a close eye on moisture and may use convection to mitigate any undesirable levels of moisture.""

Where is the API that contractually binds the independent systems? APIs are not gone. For instance, the brain of the Oven will have myriad APIs (e.g. for interacting with temperature controllers and sensors, etc.). The key here is that the interface between systems is no longer a fixed, rigid API. No method signatures, no paths, no payload specifications. Instead, a conversation relating to senses and capabilities.

What ""brain""?
Kence Anderson's book Designing Autonomous AI describes nicely how a complex system can be decomposed into a number of independent ""brains."" Each brain, in his book, can be independently developed and refined, with human guidance married with #datascience, #machinelearning and #dataengineering.

What's Cookin'?
I am excited for what the future holds. How architects rethink complex system design with regards to APIs is, in my opinion, something that is inevitable. And, as an amateur pizza maker, my taste buds are watering for the day I get some GPT help to make an even better #detroitpizza.",creative_writing

Who is the best men's test cricket player to have come from New Zealand?,,"Despite a rich cricket tradition in New Zealand, the country only became a test playing nation during the season of 1929/30, when the MCC toured the country playing 4 tests. Australia, the nearest test playing country to New Zealand, refused to grant Test status to any games played between the two nations until well after World War 2. This lack of test opportunities led to a now common path of talented New Zealanders moving off shore for the chance to play test cricket- most notably in the pre WWII period of Clarrie Grimmet, who took over 200 test wickets playing for Australia. Since then, Andrew Caddick (234 test wickets at an average of 29.91) and Ben Stokes (5000+ test runs and 196 test wickets) have played leading roles for England in tests.

If however we define the question as ""the best test cricket player to have played for New Zealand"", then there are perhaps only 3 or 4 candidates that feature. Of the current generation, there is no doubt that Kane Williamson will one day be regarded as the greatest player to have come from New Zealand- with over 8000 test runs at an average north of 50. With many years in front of him, Williamson will no doubt hold the crown of best test cricketer in years to come. 

Martin Crowe must likewise be regarded in the pantheon of test greats to have played for New Zealand- despite a slow start to his career, and injuries curtailing his time in the team, he amassed over 5000 runs at an average of over 45.

However, most will agree that the most influential cricketer ever to play test cricket for New Zealand was Sir Richard Hadlee- the first cricketer to be knighted whilst still playing cricket for his country. Hadlee's bowling average of 22.29 is one of best in test cricket history, and at the time of his retirement he held the record for test wickets, at 431. Gaining 5 wickets in an innings 36 times was also a record, and led New Zealand to some of it's most famous test victories, notably victory in a series in Australia for the first time in 1985/86, with his best test figures of 15 for 123 coming in the first test at the Gabba. Added to his bowling, his destructive lower order batting made his one of the preeminent all rounders of the game., and truly NZ's best test cricketer.",general_qa

What is a Gross domestic product (GDP)?,,"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced and sold in a specific time period by a country or countries, generally ""without double counting the intermediate goods and services used up to produce them"". GDP is most often used by the government of a single country to measure its economic health. Due to its complex and subjective nature, this measure is often revised before being considered a reliable indicator. GDP (nominal) per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) may be more useful when comparing living standards between nations, while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market. Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy. The ratio of GDP to the total population of the region is the per capita GDP (also called the Mean Standard of Living).",open_qa

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the world's second-largest country by total area, with the world's longest coastline. It is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. The country is sparsely inhabited, with the vast majority residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.

Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and culminating in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Canada is a parliamentary liberal democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The country's head of government is the prime minister, who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is ""called upon"" by the governor general, representing the monarch of Canada, the head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual (English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history, economy, and culture.

A highly developed country, Canada has one of the highest nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, G7, Group of Ten, G20, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization (WTO), Commonwealth of Nations, Arctic Council, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and Organization of American States.",summarization

Give me 3 ideas for hobbies that I can recommend to somebody who is retiring. These should all be activities that require gentle movement and are not overly demanding on the body.,,"Retirement is an exciting opportunity for people to develop and cultivate their passions. Here are a few ideas you could recommend that are both gentle on the body but require some movement:
- Gardening: while this is a seasonal pursuit, deciding on which seeds to plant, nursing them through a growing season, and learning the ins and outs of the hobby can become a lifelong passion for those with a ""green thumb""
- Walking and picking up trash: carry a bag and ""grabber"" pinchers to collect trash in your community while staying active on a walk. Rubber-tipped pinchers means you will not need to bend or stretch too far to reach, and you will be surprised how much of a difference this makes to your community members!
- Fishing: most fishing can be done from the banks of a river or lake, and is a great way to experience the calming effects of a body of water while still being physically active. Whether fly fishing or reel fishing, many people who have entered retirement find this an engaging way to engage with nature either solo or as part of a community of fisher-people.",brainstorming

What is the FA Cup?,,"The Football Association Challenge Cup, more commonly known as the FA Cup, is an annual knockout football competition in men's domestic English football. First played during the 1871–72 season, it is the oldest national football competition in the world. It is organised by and named after The Football Association (The FA). Since 2015, it has been known as The Emirates FA Cup after its headline sponsor. A concurrent Women's FA Cup has been held since 1970.

The competition is open to all eligible clubs down to Level 9 of the English football league system with Level 10 clubs acting as stand-ins in the event of non-entries from above. Included in the competition are 20 professional clubs in the Premier League (level 1), 72 professional clubs in the English Football League (levels 2 to 4), and all clubs in steps 1–5 of the National League System (levels 5 to 9) as well as a tiny number of step 6 clubs acting as stand-ins for non-entries above. A record 763 clubs competed in 2011–12. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final. Entrants are not seeded, although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds – the minimum number of games needed to win, depending on which round a team enters the competition, ranges from six to fourteen.

The first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two. The last entrants are the Premier League and Championship clubs, into the draw for the Third Round Proper. In the modern era, only one non-League team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final. As a result, significant focus is given to the smaller teams who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely ""giant-killing"" victory.

Winners receive the FA Cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and five actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design, introduced in 1911. Winners also qualify for the UEFA Europa League and a place in the upcoming FA Community Shield. Arsenal are the most successful club with fourteen titles and Arsène Wenger is the most successful manager in the history of the competition, having won seven finals as Arsenal's manager.

Liverpool are the current holders, having beaten Chelsea 6–5 on penalties following a 0–0 draw in the 2022 final.",open_qa

In other words, cultivating an awareness of what is happening in the present moment.  This is done by quietening the mind of all the random thoughts that are being continuously generated, and having the senses alerted to the signals that are being passed in the moment.  The signals are the sensations or emotions or sounds that one is feeling and hearing in the present moment.  To accomplish this, the breath serves as an anchor to the present moment.  Being aware of one's breath keeps us in the present moment.  When the mind eventually wanders, the breath is a signal to tune back into the present moment.

"When rock climbing, what is the difference between lead climbing and top rope climbing?",,"The difference between lead climbing and top rope climbing has to do with the location of the rope when the climb is started. In lead climbing the rope begins at the bottom attached to the climber as well as the belayer. The climber must then bring the rope from the bottom of the route to the top by clipping into a series of quick draws that are generally placed 10-15 feet apart. If a person were to fall while lead climbing, they would be caught by the last quick draw they clipped into. When top rope climbing, the rope is already at the top of the route. This means the climber must tie into one side of the rope while their belayer must clip into the other side of the rope. As the climber ascends higher up the route the belayer must take out the slack of the rope as opposed to lead climbing where the belayer would be giving slack. When a person falls in top rope climbing they will only fall a short distance as the rope is already clipped in above them at the top of the route, so how far they fall will be determined by how much slack the belayer has not taken in.",general_qa

Later they rewrote it in a new programming language, C, to make it portable. The availability and portability of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic institutions and businesses.

In 1977, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) from UC Berkeley, based on the 6th edition of Unix from AT&T. Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit (USL v. BSDi) in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD.[5][6]

Onyx Systems began selling early microcomputer-based Unix workstations in 1980. Later, Sun Microsystems, founded as a spin-off of a student project at Stanford University, also began selling Unix-based desktop workstations in 1982. While Sun workstations didn't utilize commodity PC hardware like Linux was later developed for, it represented the first successful commercial attempt at distributing a primarily single-user microcomputer that ran a Unix operating system.[7][8]

In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.[9] As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]

In 1985, Intel released the 80386, the first x86 microprocessor with a 32-bit instruction set and a memory management unit with paging.[10]

In 1986, Maurice J. Bach, of AT&T Bell Labs, published The Design of the UNIX Operating System.[11] This definitive description principally covered the System V Release 2 kernel, with some new features from Release 3 and BSD.

In 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. While source code for the system was available, modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's 16-bit design was not well adapted to the 32-bit features of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In the early nineties a commercial UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users.[12]

These factors and the lack of a widely adopted, free kernel provided the impetus for Torvalds' starting his project. He has stated that if either the GNU Hurd or 386BSD kernels had been available at the time, he likely would not have written his own.[13][14]",information_extraction

Why isn't multi-threading making my Python code faster? How can I fix it.,,"Python restricts access to the interpreter with a Global Interpreter Lock, referred to as the GIL, for internal thread-safety requirements. Unfortunately, this design decision restricts only allows one thread to interpret Python code at a time, even on a machine with the capability to run multiple threads together. 

If you wish to run Python code on a set of data, and the data can be broken up into independent segments (a process known as data partitioning), you may wish to look into the multiprocessing library in Python. 

As an example, consider the function foo which takes one argument, arg1, and say you wanted to run the foo function on a number of values, say, val1, val2, and val3.

def foo(arg1):
  # do something

if __name__ == '__main__':
  foo(val1)
  foo(val2)
  foo(val3)

To have foo execute on multiple processes together, you could use the multiprocessing Pool  to run multiple worker processes together:

from multiprocessing import Pool

def foo(arg1):
  # do something

if __name__ == '__main__':
  p = Pool()
  p.map(foo, [val1, val2, val3])

The multiprocessing library also provides various other APIs for parallel programming. Would you like to know more?",general_qa

How can I get better performance when querying a delta table?,,"To get better performance when querying a delta table, there are many things you can do.  

First, ensure you are using the Photon engine.  The Photon engine is designed to handle high-concurrency and low-latency queries.  If you are using DBSQL, Photon is included free of charge and is turned on by default.

Second, you can use different indexing techniques when writing a Delta table for better read performance.  Z-ordering and bloom filters are two effective techniques when used correctly.

Third, ensure your SQL Warehouse or compute resource is appropriately sized.  If you are trying to query a very large dataset from a very small warehouse, you will likely get slow query results.",general_qa

Based on how long you wish to be exposed to the market choosing an asset type that aligns with your time horizon is very important in your investment strategy.

- Risk Profile:  Indicates how confortable you are with the impact fluctuating market conditions have in your investments. Higher risk assets offer the biggest returns but they also have a higher chance of going down or loosing your investment completely. Understanding your risk profile is the first step in investing your money well. There are different investments assets that fit into different risk levels, a combination of these will offer a balanced way of investing your money.

Can I make chocolate at home?,,"Making chocolate at home can be rewarding, but be prepared to spend a little money and a lot of time. The money goes to equipment and cocoa beans. For equipment, you will need a melanger (about $600)  to grind the beans and a tempering machine (about $400) to make the finished product. You will also need a silicone mat (about $20) and a hair dryer (about $30). But let's start at the beginning.

Buy between two and six pounds of fermented raw cocoa beans. There are a variety of retail importers you can find on the web. Choose a single variety or a blend that appeals to your taste in chocolate.

Sort the beans, removing broken beans, badly misshapen beans, and whatever foreign bodies may be present.

Roast the beans, two pounds at a time, at 350F for between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on your experience with the beans or by how they smell. They will smell like fresh brownies. Don't scorch them!

Let the beans cool.

Peel the beans. You can do this by hand - which I find produces a superior product - but be warned that this can take up to 6 hours per pound. Alternatively, you can purchase a winnower and use the hair dryer to blow out the skins. This approach is much faster, but leaves more skin and loses more bean fragments. Either way, weigh your final bean yield.

Get you melanger going. Use the hair dryer to get the grinding surfaces up to at least 120F. Add the beans a handful at a time. Help the melanger along if it gets stuck. Make sure the melanger is going steadily before leaving it unattended. When it gets going, it will flow well.

Run the melanger for 24 to 72 hours, again depending on your experience with the beans and your tastes. If trying a mix of beans, add the more robustly flavored beans early in the process and the more delicately flavored beans later. Give even the most delicate beans at least 8 hours. Add sugar to taste. The percentage of sugar by weight can vary from a few percent up to 30 percent. You may also add dried whole fat milk at this point, and other flavorings, like an inch or so of vanilla bean. Melange the sugar and other additives at least 8 more hours. The goal is to decrease the particle size below what can be detected by the  tongue. When done, decant into a silicone mat line baking pan. This is your untempered chocolate. it melts easily and tends to get crumbly as it ages. Which is why you will want to temper it.

Finally, follow the directions on your tempering machine, adding chunks of untempered chocolate as indicated. The liquid tempered chocolate can be used for fruit dipping or can be poured into molds for bars or shaped candies. Other additives can be included at this stage - nuts, nougat etc. Cool the results at room temperature for several hours before serving. Enjoy the results of your labor.",creative_writing

"I'm going to give you a passage from Marty Essen's book ""Cool Creatures, Hot Planet: Exploring the Seven Continents"" and want you to answer the following question: Where are western Hermann's tortoises found?

After spending the night at a large chain hotel, Deb and I traveled southeast with tortoises on our mind. Our plan for the day was to infiltrate the Massif des Maures area and search for one of France's most endangered reptiles-- the western Hermann's tortoise.  The first stop of our quest was Le Village de Tortues (the Tortoise Village), a tortoise rehabilitation center near the town of Gonfaron. Our mission was to befriend a staff member, learn as much as we could, and get detailed information on tracking down the wily Hermann's tortoise in the wild. When we couldn't find an English-speaking staff member, our mission was nearly thwarted. Only through quick thinking and improvisation were we able to acquire the vital background information we needed. Okay - we utilized the signs provided for British visitors. For many people, the word tortoise invokes thoughts of giant four-foot-long Galapagos tortoises. Western Hermann's tortoises, on the other hand, are small, reaching a maximum length of eight inches. While both reptiles make the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the Galapagos tortoise is listed as ""vulnerable"" and the western Hermann's is listed as ""endangered."" In France, habitat destruction, egg pilfering, and fire are the primary factors for the tortoises decline.",,"Western Hermann's tortoises are found in France, in a turtle rehabilitation village, Le Village de Tortues, near Gonfaron.",general_qa

History
Tom Lamb was the son of Thomas Henry Peacock (THP) Lamb, who had emigrated from England in the late 19th century. THP Lamb turned from school teacher to fur trader and in 1900, started Lamb's Store in Moose Lake, Manitoba. Tom and his brothers and sisters grew up in northern Manitoba and worked for their father.

Tom Lamb left school before finishing grade 3. Later in life, he would make the comment, while giving his acceptance speech when receiving his honorary Doctorate of law from the University of Manitoba, ""If I had only gotten to grade 4"". At the age of 10, Tom, who had his own team of horses and sleigh, was competing with grown men in the fish hauling business. He would have to use fish boxes to step up on to be able to load his sleigh.

One of the Lamb family's businesses was ""logistics and transportation"". Fish, lumber, trees, fur and supplies needed to be hauled by any and all means. Dog teams, horses, boats, trucks and tractors were used. In the 1930s there was a transportation revolution happening. The aircraft was making its way into northern Canada. The first time Tom Lamb saw an aircraft he realized its potential. In 1930, Tom bought his first aircraft - a Stinson SR8. In 1930, Tom Lamb travelled to Winnipeg to learn to fly. To keep costs to a minimum, he lived in a tent behind the Winnipeg Flying Club. When he returned to The Pas and checked himself out on the Stinson.

In 1935, Tom incorporated Lamb Airways Limited. The airline had some name changes throughout the years and Tom became one of the best known Manitobans, if not Canadians, in the world. His adventures have been documented in books, a television documentary and even a song.",closed_qa

Substitute that in the second equation, we will get 2X + 4(25-X) = 88,
Thus 100 - 2X = 88

What is WestWorld?,westworld i an american dystopian scienc fiction western televi seri creat by jonathan nolan and lisa joi that first air on october 2 2016 on hbo it wa base upon the 1973 film of the same name written and direc by michael crichton and loos upon it 1976 sequel futureworld,"Westworld is an American dystopian science fiction western television series created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy that first aired on October 2, 2016, on HBO. It was based upon the 1973 film of the same name written and directed by Michael Crichton and loosely upon its 1976 sequel, Futureworld.

The story begins in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced Wild-West-themed amusement park populated by android ""hosts"". The park caters to high-paying guests who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans. Later on, the series' setting expands to the real world, in the mid-21st century, where people's lives are driven and controlled by a powerful artificial intelligence named Rehoboam.

Nolan and Joy served as showrunners. The second, third and fourth season followed in April 2018, March 2020, and June 2022, respectively. Nolan and Joy planned a fifth and final season, and were in negotiations with HBO to produce it.[7] However, in November 2022, it was announced that HBO had canceled the series.[8] The series was removed from HBO Max on December 18, 2022.

Westworld's debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of True Detective, in 2014. Westworld's first season is the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. The first season also received critical acclaim and was highly praised for its performances, visuals, narrative, themes and soundtrack from Ramin Djawadi. Reception of the series declined from the second season onwards, with the scripts, characterization and narrative opacity being targeted for criticism; viewership ratings also diminished throughout its run. It has received numerous accolades, winning nine Primetime Emmy Awards out of 54 nominations. Thandiwe Newton won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2018.",information_extraction

Give me three ideas for a fun dinner party,,"Here are some engaging party ideas that put food at the center!
- Tapas party: make lots of small dishes, such as stuffed mushrooms, that are easily passed and snacked on throughout an evening. This is great for a casual get together of friends, and leaves plenty of time for socializing. 

- Potluck: ask all attendees to bring one dish. This is a great way to let your guests showcase their own skills and share something they love, while also reducing the amount of prep required by the host!

- One-dish meals: if you don't want to spend all day prepping, make a fun dish such as paella (large Spanish rice dish) or chili (green or red) that you can prepare in one large serving. These can also be made to accommodate dietary restrictions, such as vegetarian or gluten-free guests.",general_qa
Why are dogs generally more popular than cats as pets?,,"Although dogs generally seem to require more time and attention, they maintain their place as number 1 pet in the majority of countries. For example, statistics have shown that over 74% of US pet owners have a dog, in comparison with 47% owning a cat. 
The reason for their popularity has to come down to their personality. Commonly, dogs are very social and affectionate creatures who enjoy spending time with their owners. Whereas, cats tend to be more independent animals by nature, and although they also require the attention of their owner, the majority prefer to keep to themselves. This stereotypical difference in behaviour is usually the main factor determining the popularity of these pets among people.",general_qa

How to raise a kitten?,,"When it comes to raise a kitten, it's like raising child. You need extra care and treat it with extra care. The first few months are a crucial time in shaping your kitten’s emotional and physical well-being. In the first 8 week, there're 4 things you should pay attention to, 1) Always keep kittens warm. Because kittens under four weeks of age do not have the ability to thermoregulate, you must help them maintain body warmth. A warmed Snuggle Safe disk at the opening of the cage or crate is a good idea. 2) Provide kittens with adequate nutrition. Kittens should gain about ½ ounce (14 grams) per day or 4 ounces (113 grams) per week. When feeding,  The temperature of the formula before feeding should be warm to around 100oF or 38oC, but not too hot.3) Keep kittens clean. If kittens are orphaned and do not have a mom to regularly groom then, it is important to teach them to groom and keep them clean. It is okay to wash a kitten with warm water but focus only on the areas needing cleaned.4) Provide socialisation with people and with other kittens. It is good to get them used to contact with people when they're 3 weeks old. They could learn from their littermates and learning from their mom. Play is the best method to help them physically and socially develop.",open_qa
What is engineering culture?,,"Engineering culture often refers to common beliefs and behaviors of engineers within a company. A strong engineering culture allows engineers to work more effectively together.

Different engineers often have different understanding or beliefs on the same topic, such as whether a PRD is needed for a design doc, or whether an engineer should write tests for their work. Without a strong engineering culture, engineers often waste timing debating on nuances, which can significantly hurt business productivity and create poor customer experience.

Large technology companies often have strong and unique engineering culture. For example: Apple favors design and quality; Amazon favors customer experience; Facebook favors success metrics; Google favors engineering excellence; Microsoft favors business success. Each engineering culture has its pros and cons. In general, having an engineering culture is better than not having one.

Web-scrapping the B2B partnership data with an automated scrapping tool or a programming language like Python- BeautifulSoup is a highly fragile process.

Write a guide for how to catch a smallmouth bass.,,"The smallmouth bass is a common freshwater fish, found in the rivers and lakes of North America. Its habitat stretches between northeastern Canada and a small range of waterways in Mexico. Fishermen of all ages enjoy catching the smallmouth bass, because of its propensity for jumping out of the water and trying to evade capture with vigor. You will find smallmouth enjoying shallower waters in the cool parts of the day, attracted to surface baits like imitation frogs, minnows, and spinnerbaits. As the day warms up, smallmouth retreat to cooler waters, and you might find them schooling near a drop-off or around a deep-water mound. Smallmouth are typically caught between June and October.

Note: Please adhere to local fishing regulations to know when smallmouth bass are in season. Most jurisdictions require a license to fish and have limits on how many fish can be kept.",creative_writing

How do I cast on a knitting project?,,"Casting on is how to make the first row of stitches. Each method of casting on can look and feel slightly different (such as various levels of stretchiness and flexibility) so most knitters have their preferred cast on method. Many use the long-tail cast on method which can work for many projects.  First, measure the length of yarn that is about 4 times as long as the width of your project. For example, if the width of your project is 10 inches, measure out a 40 inch piece of yarn. Next, time a slip knot. Then, place the slip knot on your dominant hand’s needle with the yarn tail closest to you (the tail is the length you measured out). Hold both strands of yarn with your non-dominant hand. Spread the two strands of yarn out with your thumb and forefinger, then bring the knitting needle in your right hand to the front of the tail of yarn draped over your thumb. Bring the needle back, up and through the loop toward your thumb loop, then push the needle back and under the forefinger loop, allowing the needle to catch the forefinger loop and allowing the thumb loop to fall off under the needle. That’s your first cast on stitch. Repeat the steps for the total number of stitches you need.",general_qa

How to calculate growth rate?,,"The term “growth rate” describes the rate of change in the value of a specific metric across a given time period, expressed as a percentage.

Common examples of scenarios where the growth rate is often used are the following:

Company Sales
Population Figures
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
Inflation Rate
Under the specific context of financial modeling, the growth rate is most frequently on a quarterly or annual basis (i.e. year-over-year).

More defensible predictions can be made about the future trajectory of a metric in question by determining its historical growth, which can serve as a practical point of reference for forecasting purposes.

However, the metric’s usefulness is still tied to the extent that the underlying drivers are identified and researched in-depth.

By itself, calculating the historical growth is not enough, because what actually caused the past growth and which qualitative factors are likely to determine a metric’s future growth must also be clearly understood.


The following formula can be used to calculate the growth rate across two periods.

Growth Rate (%) = (Ending Value ÷ Beginning Value) – 1
For example, if a company’s revenue was $100 million in 2020 and grew to $120 million in 2021, its year-over-year (YoY) growth rate is 20%.

Growth Rate = ($120 million ÷ $100 million) – 1 = 0.20, or 20%",general_qa

This animal is almost extinct, and is important to the native ecosystem; the kiwi keeps the bug population down and is hunted by natural predators.

What is Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India,,"The Unified Payments Interface is a Peer to Peer payments system launched in India by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016. NPCI set out with a mandate to change the face of India’s payment systems. It developed the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as an architecture framework with a set of standard Application Programming Interface (API) specifications to facilitate online payments. The aim was to simplify and provide a single interface across all NPCI systems, thereby creating interoperability and a superior customer experience.

UPI is now one of the most preferred payment solutions in India, with over a billion transactions every month. FY22, the total transaction value processed by the United Payments Interface (UPI) platform accounted for 86% of India’s GDP. UPI’s core function is to support easy and secure money transfers between bank accounts. It does this by adding multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application, allowing for seamless fund transfers and merchant payments from one place. It also enables ‘peer to peer’ and ‘peer to merchant’ collection requests, which can be scheduled and paid as requested.

Payments can be made using a UPI ID, UPI Number, Account number, and an Indian Financial System Code (IFSC). Payment security is as per applicable Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines using a 1-click 2-factor authentication where the second factor of authentication is the UPI PIN. 

UPI can be accessed on all major platforms such as Android and iOS with apps developed by members for versions of Android 4.2.2 and iOS 8.1 and above.

The primary business uses of UPI are to allow a personal mobile as the primary device for all payments, including person to person, person to entity, and entity to person. Using a personal mobile an individual can ‘Pay’ someone (push) as well as ‘Collect’ from
someone (pull). In addition, the ability to pay and collect using ‘UPI IDs’ that are ‘aliases’ to the VPA. The goal is to make  payments by providing an address without having to ever provide account details or credentials on third party applications or websites.
Also, sending ‘collect’ requests to others (person to person or entity to person) with a‘pay by’ date, which allows customers to pay at a later date without blocking the money in the account. UPI also allows for pre-authorizing multiple recurring payments (utilities, school fees, subscriptions, etc.) with a one-time secure authentication and rule-based access, similar to ECS. UPI autopay allows customers to set recurring payments for their UPI transactions. Recurring payments up to Indian Rupees 2000 can be set at the frequency desired.

This makes payments using UPI a fully interoperable system across all PSPs without having silos and closed systems with one-click two-factor authentication, using a personal
phone, and without any acquiring devices or physical tokens.

In March 2023, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the linkage of UPI and Singapore’s PayNow. Remittances from Singapore to India were on track to breach the $100 billion mark in 2023, making it the fourth highest remitting nation to India, accounting for 5.7% of all inbound remittances. Integrating PayNow and UPI will likely reduce charges and the time taken for such transactions.",general_qa

- MPT attempts to minimize risks in the form of variance. However, this metric doesn’t reflect investors’ true concerns in practice. Variance is symmetric, so it punishes high returns the same way as high losses. However, investors care more about loss than gain, so the perception of risk is asymmetric in nature. Coherent risk measures should be a better metric that reflects investors’ preference
- MPT assumes that returns follow Gaussian distribution. However, many scholars suggest that returns might follow other distributions such as stable distributions
- MPT relies on the efficient-market hypothesis and assumes that share price fluctuation is a risk measure. However, building a portfolio based on historical volatility is a questionable premise criticized by Sir John Templeton",information_extraction

Explain how a mechanical watch works,,"A simple mechanical watch works by transferring power from the main spring, a tightly coiled metal spring, through an escapement and balance wheel, to wheels representing seconds, minutes, and hours.

The watch uses a gearing from the main spring that pushes an escapement gearing against a ruby palette to oscillate a balance wheel. The balance wheel and escapement are carefully constructed to oscillate at a specific frequency, releasing small bursts of power to the gear train. The train is constructed to gear the specific frequency of the balance wheel into seconds, minutes and hours. 

Further complications like chronographs, sun phase, alarms, and others are not accounted for in this simple watch. An automatic watch contains a weighted rotor in order to wind the mainspring with the motion of a person's arm.",brainstorming

Why are all the planets and moons round in shape? What makes them round? Does there exist another shape?,,"Not all planets and moons are round. There is some variety in their shapes depending on their masses, and curiously looking worlds might even exist, unlike anything we know from our system.

Everything within a planet or a moon is under the influence of gravity in such a way that bits of it would move to the center if they could. Under ideal conditions, it would acquire a spherical shape. For objects made of something other than liquids, it varies at what point they become round. It is generally assumed that they mostly become spheres around 400 kilometers/248 miles in diameter when made from icy material commonly found in our Solar System. Still, if something is made from something more rigid, it needs to be larger in diameter than that - around 750 km/466 miles. At a sufficient mass, even rock becomes fluid-like. The moon of Mars Deimos is only 12.6 km/7.8 miles across and is not spherical, and there are many other small moons of other planets that don’t have a round shape.

This, however, is not all. Astronomical objects spin, giving them the flattened shape of a sphere the faster their rotation if they are massive enough. On top of it, they can have moons. This causes a bulge to form at the position of their orbiting body around them. In the case of Earth, our Moon causes tides via this process. Also, our Sun gives our planet tides. Elsewhere in the Universe, there could be planets with massive moons or two similarly massive planets, called double planets, orbiting their common center of mass, the barycenter, at a close distance, which can cause even stronger bulging. Their shape would be affected this way more visibly.

Finally, a bizarre, toroidal planet, shown above, can be stable from what we know from physics, at least for a while. As I mentioned earlier, even rigid rock behaves like a fluid at large masses. An adequate rotation speed can counterbalance the strength of gravity with centrifugal acceleration, and a torus-shaped planet could exist. A possible scenario for such a world to come to be would be if two sufficiently fast rotating planets collided and formed a doughnut of vaporized rock, a so-called synestia.

We currently think that the events that would lead to the formation of a world of this shape are so unlikely that there might not be a single toroidal planet in the Visible Universe, but we were quite a few times surprised by what we discovered during our exploration of Cosmos. Perhaps we will even find a doughnut shape world one day.",general_qa
what are the advantages of having a vegetable garden at home on the owners health?,,Vegetable garden allows you to think about the healthy factors of each vegetable. You can prioritize the health benefits of each vegetable and compare against how frequently you use that vegetable. You can plan on how many plants of each variety will be needed for making a dinner for your family. You will try to find vegetables that are easy to maintain and grow with minimal supervision. You will mix between vegetables that will grow in summer verses mild cold temperatures and choose your planting time. If you want year around produce of fresh vegetables you can even plan to have a green house with heating to keep your plants alive in all seasons. Making the soil ready and adding some plant food at regular intervals is required to keep the produce at good numbers. The owner will have health benefits of stress free time during the time they work on the garden and when they see the produce on the dinner table in the form of a delicious dish. Owners have a great time posting their produce pictures and dishes to social media to share with friends. Each year they plan 3 to 4 months in advance on the kind of plants that they would like to plant in the garden. They work with friends to find the seeds for various plants that they like to plant as well as share tips to keep the garden healthy. The key benefit is the owner will be able to get fresh produce that does not use any harsh chemicals or pesticides.,general_qa

Could you write a poem about a standing desk?,,"The Standing Desk


Two doors down
Standing in the corner
Looking out the window 
Is your desk
Back turned
Wailing at all of us
Wondering why we can’t hear it
Whispering sometimes with secrets for the room

When the door closes, it is particularly loud 
Screaming, screaming mad
Angry and lonely 
Moaning now for us to find its partner 
Groaning now for why, why, why
And only when it hears the occupants in the room questioning and turning to stare is it mollified 

We unplugged it to keep it quiet
Left it tall and high at the position you liked best
Chair tucked neatly under
Gleaming clean and bear, beckoning for the next master 
And when everyone is busy 
Meeting our many meetings
It hums softly (usually that same song you taught it), seemingly content and happy 

People enter, come and go
And the Observer watches and waits for a pause 
Wanting to insert something weird and funny
I glare at it when I come in
It knows, I know.
I know, I know! Shhhhhh! 
“We’re working on it,” I say
It raises a brow at me 
I roll my eyes at it and shake my head
“Not enough!”, it throws at me as I slink out walking backwards 

Searching, I stay out of sight
Looking for its new companion
Specs on hand, omissions at the back of my throat
Someone smart, yet dumb enough
Someone commanding, yet submissive
Someone current, yet mature
Someone good but not too much 
“Someone who will stay,” the desk whispers hopefully 

I grimace and say: 
“I’ll take someone tall enough for the desk!”

It taunts and laughs at me
While the memories flood in 
And I start to laugh too
And the desk and I share a grin 

“Not funny,” I say
The desk shrugs and finally stays quiet 

One day, when everyone was gone, I sneak in and stand before it 
Power it up and press the down button so I can rest my elbows on its smooth surface 
And I look out the dark window
In unison, we share a heavy sigh 
Choked up, I whisper: “A new person will be here soon and I’ll be gone.
Watch over everyone, will you?”
The desk nods quietly, lump in throat 

I take an orange sticker and press it gently underneath as a reminder of its promise 
And then walk two doors down to add one to my own desk before heading home for the night
As the elevator takes me down, the desk scans the empty office, takes a deep breath, and stands at the ready, a white knight brave but trembling, and starts humming your song.",general_qa

What criteria should I be looking at when buying a new motorcycle?,,"There are a number of criteria you should be looking at:
- Price: How does it fit in your budget?
- Engine type: Do you want a traditional combustion engine, or go for an electric one?
- Number of cylinders: If you go for combustion engine, how many cylinders do you choose? Less cylinders are usually cheaper, make the motorcycle more lightweight and thus easier to maneuver. More cylinders make the engine feel smoother, also have more power, but are heavier and more expensive.
- Usage: What do you use it for? Just for fun, commuting to work, general transportation? Travel? Offroad? Racing?
- Assistance systems: Modern motorcycles have a range of assistance systems like ABS, Cruise Control, Distance sensors, electronic driving modes for different weather conditions etc. They can make driving safer , but also add weight and make the bike more expensive. Which ones do you need?  
- Style: There are different styles like naked bike, cruiser, chopper, dual sport, race bike , scrambler etc. Different styles can be more or less adequate depending on your usage, or you can simply pick the one that appeals to you.
- Size: The two most important aspects in terms of size are seat height and weight. Both have a huge impact on how well you are in control when not driving, for example when you need to stop at a traffic light or going slowly in stop & go traffic.
Seat height is important , so your feet can reach the ground when stopping. However the width of the seat and general width dimensions of the bike also play a role here. So two bikes with same seat height might feel very differently. Best is to try it out",brainstorming

Are plastic bags and containers bad for the environment?,,"In short, yes.

Surprisingly, though, that has not always been the consensus, and in some cases, it is not true.

In the 1970s energy crisis, reducing the weight of materials, and increasing the shelf life of goods (which helps with optimizing transportation methods) were widely lauded as environmentally positive. In short, paper bags weigh more than plastic bags, and transportation requires fossil fuels, and of course fossil fuels impact the environment in widely documented ways.

Also, some plastics like PET have great recycling track records. So if it reduces energy consumption, increases shelf life, and can be recycled it seems like a huge environmental win.

However, plastics are very durable, and now micro-plastics are everywhere. They are in the deepest ocean trenches, accumulated in many species of animals and plants, and will be for our lifetimes. Their toxicity and negative impacts are just beginning to be understood. This has driven the removal of ""single use plastics"" from a lot of commerce, with further reductions called for by environmental groups worldwide.",creative_writing

You should find your racket on the right side of your body, now hold it loosely with your right hand using a semi-western grip, release your left hand and move it in the direction of the incoming ball. At the same time, step out using your left leg so the distance between your legs is a little bit wider than your shoulders, and keep your center of gravity on your right leg.
Now the ball starts to bounce and reach its highest point, you are going to hit the ball. You push your right foot to the ground and move your body weight from bottom to front, lower the racket head, and turn your pelvis from right to left at the same time. All of these powers combine into the force toward the front and your right-hand uses it to pull your racket from back to front and hit the ball right at the sweet point of your racket, keep pushing the racket until it reaches a limit where you cannot push any more and then release your racket and let the racket‘s inertia lead you from right to left.

To make one for yourself:
1. Get a good protein source, typically a protein powder. Casein and Whey proteins are popular choices.

What are some plastic use reduction ideas,,"Plastic is a pollutant that won't easily degrade. However; its versatility can't be dismissed and its not easy to get away from its usage in our day to day lives. We can however optimize and reduce the usage.

2) If you don't have your own reusable grocery bag please insist your grocery store to bag your groceries in paper bags
3) This may be a surprise to you but the inner lining of canned beverages is plastic. So getting canned beverages may not be a 100% plastic free experience it's a much effective one than having the same beverage in a plastic bottle

How is data engineering different from data science?,,"Data Engineering occurs before data science in the data lifecycle. Data can be generated from various sources and this raw data may be structured, semi structured or even unstructured. To make sense of this data, data has to be ingested and transformed. This is when data engineering comes into picture. Data engineering includes the process of extracting the raw data, ingesting data into a system like a data lake, transforming the data for business needs and finally loading it into a table. This is commonly known as ELT (Extract-Load-Transform). ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) is also possible where transformation happens before the loading stage.
Data Science and Analytics is the next step in the data lifecycle. Once the data needed for specific business need is available, data scientists use this data to run machine learning models to find the most accurate model. This data is available to the data scientists in the form of tables. Data analysts also use this data to do some exploratory analysis and create dashboards. 
In essence, the data lifecycle would look as follows:

How reliable is public transportation?,,"Reliability of public transportation varies drastically depending on which city you are in and depends on investment and maintenance of existing infrastructure. For example, the public transportation network in Switzerland spans a wide network that comprises of trains, trams, busses, and ferries, runs timely on a schedule to the minute, and is used as a primary mode of transportation for many residents. In contrast, it can be challenging to get around many cities in the United States without a car.

This creates an unfortunate cycle making it very difficult for public transportation to become more reliable without external investments where the system is funding itself.",open_qa

"Which is more important, Nature or Nurture?",,"The Nature vs Nurture argument has existed for as long as humans have been able to consider complex thought. The debate as to whether the nature (the intrinsic nature, the attitude, or the predisposition), or the nurture (the care, the teachings, or the conditioning) of a child is more responsible for who or what they become in adult life. 

Largely it is considered that humans are a product of context (Nurture). The situations in which we are raised have a considerable bearing on who we become in later life. But, it's not necessarily so black and white. There are countless examples of children having been born into extremely difficult circumstances, who have grown to be well rounded, high contributing members of society. 

As a result, It would be reasonable to assume that Nature is a strong factor, regardless of the Nurture (the environment) in which a person is raised. After all, there's no guarantee that someone growing up in an abusive household will then abuse others themselves. So then is Nature more important? 

The difficulty with the debate is that no one individual is the same as another. Experiments to establish the efficacy of Nature vs Nurture are difficult to perform. Not only from a human rights perspective, but additionally from a variable standpoint as well. Really there are far too many variables to control with regards to human nature, that any imposition of control on the Nurture element would be imbalanced. 

When considering this question, it's important to recognise that developmental psychology is still in its early stages, and to understand that both Nature AND Nurture are necessary factors in human development.",creative_writing

What is the difference between common law and civil law?,,"The primary difference between common law and civil law is that in common law jurisdictions, published court decisions are of primary importance to understanding legal rules. In civil law jurisdictions, published rules or statutes are of primary importance. Common law's origins are found in England, where court decisions filled in gaps in ""writs"" issued by the monarch. Civil law, by comparison, traces its origins to codes of laws compiled beginning around the time of the Roman Empire. 

While there are around 150 countries that largely follow a common law model, and 80 that follow a civil law model, the reality is that many jurisdictions incorporate elements of both common law and civil law. Even within a country, different models may apply.",general_qa

How does running slow make you run faster?,,"There has been a recent shift in thinking about the types of training that makes a distance runner faster while mitigating the risk of injuries.  It has been found that running up to 80% of your  weekly miles at a very comfortable slow pace was optimal for the fastest improvement.  A slow pace can be measured by running at or below 70% of your maximum heart rate (MHR=220 beats per minute minus your age).  For those who don't have a heart rate monitor, another way to measure that you are in this zone is by being able to have a conversation without being out of breath. This “run slow to get faster"" methodology has been embraced by the elite running community and some believe has contributed to the multiple recent world records for both men and women in the middle and long distances.  This has also been shown to have the same effect on beginner runners and had tremendous benefits that resulted in improved overall speed performance, while reducing the risk of injury in getting to your race day.",general_qa

Later, speaking on the Laura Kuenssberg programme on BBC One, Braverman denied the situation at Dover would repeat itself and blamed “bad weather”.

But her comments variously attracted ire and ridicule. The Liberal Democrats’ home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said: “These comments show Suella Braverman is in complete denial about the impact of the Conservative government’s botched deal with Europe on our borders. For Conservative ministers like Braverman, it is always someone else’s fault.

“Businesses and travellers are being tied up in reams of red tape but ministers are refusing to lift a finger. It shows the Conservative party is out of touch, out of excuses and should be out of power.”

The former Conservative cabinet minister David Gauke, who was stripped of the Tory whip for rebelling in a Brexit vote, tweeted: “If we were in the EU, the French would not need to do individual passport checks. If no individual passport checks, the process at Dover would be quicker. The Dover queues are, therefore, partly caused by Brexit. Not a contentious point, surely?”

Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, described Braverman as being “on another planet as usual”. She said that the home secretary’s comments regarding no Brexit link contradicted those expressed by the port’s chief executive. In an interview with the Observer a year ago, Doug Bannister, admitted Brexit was causing longer processing times at the border.",,"- Doug Bannister

There are box-office gross revenue lists, which are not adjusted for inflation, as well as lists for the number of box-office ticket sales. Because of the long-term effects of inflation on movie theater ticket prices, a list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later actors. Therefore, the gross revenue lists are largely meaningless for comparing acting careers widely separated in time, as many actors from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite their films' achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.

It is a philosophy of personal virtue ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world, asserting that the practice of virtue is both necessary and sufficient to achieve eudaimonia (happiness, lit. 'good spiritedness'): one flourishes by living an ethical life. The Stoics identified the path to eudaimonia with a life spent practicing virtue and living in accordance with nature.

Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue ethics.[1] The Stoics are especially known for teaching that ""virtue is the only good"" for human beings, and that external things, such as health, wealth, and pleasure, are not good or bad in themselves (adiaphora) but have value as ""material for virtue to act upon"". Many Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus—emphasized that because ""virtue is sufficient for happiness"", a sage would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is ""in accordance with nature"". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved.[2] To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they believed everything was rooted in nature.

Stoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century CE, and among its adherents was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century CE. Since then, it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism).[3]",summarization

Write a paragraph about AI governance.,,"The AI arms race is heating up, and breakthroughs are happening at an accelerating pace.

The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI represents a profound leap forward in how humans interface with machines, showcasing the startling progress in large language models. Meanwhile generative AI capabilities such as Dall-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney are able to generate highly realistic and detailed images from text descriptions, demonstrating a level of creativity and imagination that was once thought to be exclusively human.

Humans seem fundamentally wired to continuously advance technology and improve our knowledge and capabilities. Also, the human brain tends to think linearly, causing us to underestimate the exponential progress of technology. Companies and nations are incentivized by market forces and geopolitical game theory to pursue better intelligence through the advancement of AI.

The Future of Life Institute recently published Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter. The letter — with notable signatories including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Andrew Yang — caused a stir, calling for a 6 month pause on advanced AI development:

“Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.”

Much of the media and public discourse in response to this letter has focused on who signed it and pushing back on the notion that humanity faces an imminent existential threat of artificial superintelligence. Dystopian claims of runaway artificial intelligence seem hyperbolic to many people, and calling for a 6 month moratorium is not realistic. Good luck convincing China to “pause” their efforts in the AI arms race.

But are there no boundaries? Should we proceed with no guidelines?

For example …

Are we comfortable outsourcing decisions to black box AI systems that lack transparency and explainability, making it impossible for humans to understand the reasoning behind decisions?
Should we be worried about the development of AI-powered autonomous weapons that make decisions about the use of lethal force without human input?
Should we be worried about the potential for malicious actors to use AI for nefarious purposes, such as sophisticated propaganda campaigns?
Are our current laws, regulations and political systems equipped to handle the rapid influx of new AI alignment questions that society will grapple with in the very near future?
As AI becomes more advanced, it may become difficult to understand, which could lead to unintended outcomes. AI systems can behave in ways that are unforeseen and difficult to control. The AI alignment problem is a societal challenge that requires collaboration between researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and the public. It will also require international cooperation between governments and the private sector. This is not just a technical challenge, but also a philosophical and ethical one.

The open letter mentioned above goes on to recommend:

“AI research and development should be refocused on making today’s powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal.”

This is certainly a worthy goal, and it can be achieved by doing AI in the open. What we currently lack is a framework. Society needs a set of procedures and protocols to make the recommendation from The Future of Life Institute actionable.

Jointly, we must consider and debate the pros and cons of many ideas, including but not limited to:

Mandatory disclosure of model details, including training datasets, evaluation methodologies, and known biases
Development of a framework that establishes model monitoring and audit requirements for advanced AI systems
Implementation of laws that impose liability for AI-caused harm
Establishment of a regulatory authority for oversight and tracking of highly capable AI systems
The first step in achieving a productive framework for safe AI development is an open dialogue among the many stakeholders involved, which includes everyone. We must rise above the hyper-politicized discourse that our dishonest and broken media often forces upon us. This topic is too important and the ramifications are too profound. Join me in advocating for an intelligent and respectful conversation on AI — one that solicits input and open debate from a diverse set of voices to help ensure a path forward that is in our collective best interest.",creative_writing

Who is Malcolm X?,malcolm x born malcolm littl later el hajj malik el shabazz mai 19 1925 februari 21 1965 wa an american muslim minist and human right activist who wa a promin figur dure the civil right movem a spokesman for the nation of islam until 1964 he wa a vocal advoc for black empower and the promot of islam within the black commun a posthum autobiographi on which he collabor with alex halei wa publis in 1965,"Malcolm X (born Malcolm Little, later el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz; May 19, 1925 – February 21, 1965) was an American Muslim minister and human rights activist who was a prominent figure during the civil rights movement. A spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the Black community. A posthumous autobiography, on which he collaborated with Alex Haley, was published in 1965.

Malcolm spent his adolescence living in a series of foster homes or with relatives after his father's death and his mother's hospitalization. He committed various crimes, being sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1946 for larceny and burglary. In prison he joined the Nation of Islam (adopting the name Malcolm X to symbolize his unknown African ancestral surname while discarding ""the White slavemaster name of 'Little'""), and after his parole in 1952 quickly became one of the organization's most influential leaders. He was the public face of the organization for 12 years, advocating Black empowerment and separation of Black and White Americans, and criticizing Martin Luther King Jr. and the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on nonviolence and racial integration.[2][3] Malcolm X also expressed pride in some of the Nation's social welfare achievements, such as its free drug rehabilitation program. From the 1950s onward, Malcolm X was subjected to surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

In the 1960s, Malcolm X began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, as well as with its leader, Elijah Muhammad. He subsequently embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to Mecca, and became known as ""el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz,""[4] which roughly translates to ""The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch"".[5][6][7] After a brief period of travel across Africa, he publicly renounced the Nation of Islam and founded the Islamic Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Throughout 1964, his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly sent death threats. On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences; in 2021, two of the convictions were vacated. Speculation about the assassination and whether it was conceived or aided by leading or additional members of the Nation, or with law enforcement agencies, has persisted for decades.

A controversial figure accused of preaching racism and violence, Malcolm X is also a widely celebrated figure within African-American and Muslim American communities for his pursuit of racial justice. He was posthumously honored with Malcolm X Day, on which he is commemorated in various cities across the United States. Hundreds of streets and schools in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, while the Audubon Ballroom, the site of his assassination, was partly redeveloped in 2005 to accommodate the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center.",information_extraction

What causes ocean tides?,,"Tides are very long waves moving across the ocean and are caused by the gravitational forces exerted on the earth by the moon. When the highest point in the long-period wave reaches a shoreline the area experiences high tide. When the lowest point of the wave, the trough, reaches shore the area experiences low tide. The earth is mostly water and the water ""points"" at the moon, the parts of the Earth experiencing high tide is the water drawing towards the moon. The ""pointing"" water that faces the moon is formed because the gravitational pull of the moon is strongest on whichever side of the Earth faces it. Gravity pulls the ocean towards the moon and high tide occurs.

The bulge on the far side of the Earth is caused by inertia. The water moving away from the moon resists the gravitational forces that attempt to pull it in the opposite direction. Because the gravitational pull of the moon is weaker on the far side of the Earth, inertia wins, the ocean bulges out and high tide occurs. As the Earth spins, different areas of the planet face the moon, and this rotation causes the tides to cycle around the planet.",general_qa

Are the Golden State Warriors a good basketball team?,,"The Golden State Warriors won the most recent NBA championship in 2022.  In the last 8 years they reached the NBA finals 6 times, won 4 championships, and set the record for regular seasons wins with 73.  Stephen Curry, the Warriors best player, also won the NBA Most Valuable Player award twice during that same span.  This success is generally regarded as a dynasty, a term used to describe a dominating team over a long period.

However, this season the Warriors have struggled.  Despite winning the most recent NBA championship only 9 months ago, near the end of this regular season they are only a few games above .500.  Their current record is 42-38 as of today, which is only the 13th best record in the NBA out of 30 teams.

The reason for the drop is not clear.  The Warriors have the same starting lineup as last year with 4 All-Stars and when playing at Home their record is among the best in the league.  However, when playing on the road the Warriors have one of the worst records at 9-30.  A big factor in their road losses is lack of good defense, as opposing teams score considerably more points against the Warriors than when the Warriors play at home.  There seems to be a lack of focus and intensity from the Warriors players on defense in these away games and in the NBA, where the margin between winning and losing is very thin, that has seemed to make the difference.",open_qa

What would be the pros and cons of replacing all civilian airplanes with dirigibles?,,"Replacing all civilian airplanes with dirigibles would have positive and negative effects. The most notable positive effect would be reduced environmental impact: although dirigibles, like airplanes, need engines, dirigibles are filled with lighter-than-air gas and therefore no power is needed to counteract gravity, so they consume less fuel. However, there would be a significant negative economic impact because dirigibles fly much more slowly than airplanes, thus the items airplanes carry (e.g. people and freight) would take much longer to get to their destination. In addition, another problem with dirigibles is that they are less able to handle strong winds compared to airplanes, so it might be necessary for the dirigible to take a more circuitous route than an airplane, or simply delay the flight until the bad weather passes.",general_qa

What is a bond in finance?,,"In finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to provide cash flow to the creditor (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date as well as interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time).The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds. The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.

Bonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors, in the event of bankruptcy. Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, which is a perpetuity, that is, a bond with no maturity. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are classified as money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.

The most common forms include municipal, corporate, and government bonds. Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion-stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market. The price of a bond in the secondary market may differ substantially from the principal due to various factors in bond valuation.",open_qa

Why is my baby crying right now?,,"The first thing to check is if your baby is hungry. It’s by far the most common reason they cry.

This is where they open their mouth and turn towards your touch, as if they were looking for the source of food.

If they’re not hungry, they’re possibly tired. Babies can become over tired and cry and fuss, even when you are just trying to get them to sleep. If this is the case you’ll need to calm them down first, and then you can get them to sleep.

Finally sometimes babies just cry for no reason. Isn’t parenting fun?",general_qa

Give me a summary of 1812 war,the war of 1812 18 june 1812 17 februari 1815 wa fought by the unite state of america and it indigen alli against the unite kingdom and it alli in british north america with limit particip by spain in florida tension origin in long stan differ over territori expan in north america and british support for nativ american tribe who oppos u s coloni settlem in the northwest territori,"The War of 1812 (18 June 1812 – 17 February 1815) was fought by the United States of America and its indigenous allies against the United Kingdom and its allies in British North America, with limited participation by Spain in Florida. It began when the United States declared war on 18 June 1812. Although peace terms were agreed upon in the December 1814 Treaty of Ghent, the war did not officially end until the peace treaty was ratified by Congress on 17 February 1815.[11][12]

Tensions originated in long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Native American tribes who opposed U.S. colonial settlement in the Northwest Territory. These escalated in 1807 after the Royal Navy began enforcing tighter restrictions on American trade with France and press-ganged men they claimed as British subjects, even those with American citizenship certificates.[13] Opinion in the U.S. was split on how to respond, and although majorities in both the House and Senate voted for war, they divided along strict party lines, with the Democratic-Republican Party in favour and the Federalist Party against.[d][14] News of British concessions made in an attempt to avoid war did not reach the U.S. until late July, by which time the conflict was already underway.
At sea, the far larger Royal Navy imposed an effective blockade on U.S. maritime trade, while between 1812 to 1814 British regulars and colonial militia defeated a series of American attacks on Upper Canada.[15] This was balanced by the US winning control of the Northwest Territory with victories at Lake Erie and the Thames in 1813. The abdication of Napoleon in early 1814 allowed the British to send additional troops to North America and the Royal Navy to reinforce their blockade, crippling the American economy.[16] In August 1814, negotiations began in Ghent, with both sides wanting peace; the British economy had been severely impacted by the trade embargo, while the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention in December to formalise their opposition to the war.

In August 1814, British troops burned Washington, before American victories at Baltimore and Plattsburgh in September ended fighting in the north. Fighting continued in the Southeastern United States, where in late 1813 a civil war had broken out between a Creek faction supported by Spanish and British traders and those backed by the U.S. Supported by U.S. militia under General Andrew Jackson, the U.S.-backed Creeks won a series of victories, culminating in the capture of Pensacola in November 1814.[17] In early 1815, Jackson defeated a British attack on New Orleans, catapulting him to national celebrity and later victory in the 1828 United States presidential election.[18] News of this success arrived in Washington at the same time as that of the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which essentially restored the position to that prevailing before the war. While Britain insisted this included lands belonging to their Native American allies prior to 1811, as Congress did not recognize them as independent nations, the Americans did not comply with these provisions and the British made no effort to compel them to do so. The Native Americans were subsequently pushed west of the Mississippi River.",summarization

"Write a short story about a little girl who befriends a dragon, the dragons magical powers can bring her to a different universe.",,"Once upon a time there was a little girl who dreamed every day of finding a dragon. This particular Tuesday morning when she was waiting for the bus, she spotted a shiny object on the sidewalk. She leaned down to pick it up and it glimmered in the sunshine. She had never seen such a brilliant treasure, it was the color of the rainbow, and when she looked closer it looked eerily similar to a dragon scale, but she couldn't believe that it was truly a dragon scale because they only existed in the stories she read. She looked around and spotted another shiny scale, like a trail of breadcrumbs leading her to the forest behind her house. She knew that her parents would want her to go to school but her curiosity got the better of her and she started to follow the trail of shiny scales to the forest. She fought her way through the forest until she came upon what looked like a cave that she was sure was not there before. She cautiously entered the cave and and instead of the cave getting darker, it was getting brighter, like a brilliant light was inside the cave. When she turned the corner in the cave, she saw the most beautiful sparkling dragon and could not believe her eyes! She slowly crept toward the dragon, who was watching her closely as she approached. She held out her hand as if to pet the dragon and the dragon sniffed her hand, then rubbed it's head on the bottom of her hand to signal that it wanted to befriend her. She giggled as the dragon purred and rubbed it's shiny body circling around her. The dragon then spoke and asked her if she had ever been to the beyond worlds. The girl shook her head, the dragon blinked her eyes and projected an image onto the cave wall to show one of the beautiful beyond worlds that was filled with dragons. The girl asked if the dragon would take her there, the dragon laughed and nodded, signaling for the girl to jump on it's back. The rush of excitement came over the girl, and she hopped on the dragons back. She held on tight as the dragon started running out of the cave, as the dragon exited the cave a portal opened and it leaped into the portal. The girl closed her eyes, not knowing what would happen next, she finally opened her eyes and gawked with amazement when they arrived in the beyond world, she could not believe what she was seeing, DRAGONS! DRAGONS EVERYWHERE! They were riding over the rainbow, playing in the waterfalls, and the universe was full of beautiful flowers towering as tall as redwood trees. The sky was purple and the world had 10 moons as she glanced up in the sky.......this was going to be a great adventure!",creative_writing

Why do people like the game Diplomacy?,,"Diplomacy is a strategic board game that does not rely on dice or other game elements to introduce randomness into results of gameplay. In the game Diplomacy, players negotiate, form alliances, and betray each other in an effort to occupy geographic provinces and control of ""supply centers"" to win the game. 

People like playing the game Diplomacy because it is unique compared to other strategic board games. In Diplomacy, all players submit their ""orders"" to move their pieces around the board into a box and those orders are adjudicated at the same time, making it difficult to gain an advantage over another player without communicating and planning out moves with other players. The only variable in the game is each player's ability to convince the other players to do what they want. Some people find this aspect of negotiation-based game play compelling, while others find the ""anything goes"" nature of these negotiations repelling. Therefore, Diplomacy is sometimes referred to as the ""game that ruins friendships.""",creative_writing

write short essay on Neil Armstrong experience on moon,,"On July 20th, 1969, Neil Armstrong, an American astronaut, made history by becoming the first human to set foot on the Moon. As he stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously uttered the words, ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.""

Armstrong's experience on the Moon was a momentous occasion that captured the world's attention. He spent just over two hours outside the spacecraft, collecting samples, conducting experiments, and taking photographs. He was joined by fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who followed him out of the lunar module a short while later.

Despite the excitement of the moment, Armstrong later described his time on the Moon as a serene and otherworldly experience. The Moon's surface was eerily quiet, with no atmosphere to carry sound. Armstrong described the sky as ""completely black,"" and the Earth as a ""magnificent, lonely"" sight in the distance.

Armstrong's mission to the Moon was a triumph of human ingenuity and perseverance. It marked a new era in space exploration and cemented America's position as a leader in the field.

what is one good example on a hackathon project for a middle school student for programming?,,"After months of lockdowns and social distancing, schools finally reopened for in-person classes, and parents are thrilled to be able to attend their children's concerts and performances once again. Many parents had missed these events and were eager to show their support for their children's artistic pursuits. Parents are excited to attend her in-person concert, but many of them quickly realized that they didn't know much about classical music, which made it difficult for them to fully appreciate the performance.

As a kid who loves music, I always feel so proud and happy when my parents attend my concerts and performances. However, I often wonder if they are truly able to enjoy the music as much as I do, especially since they may not know much about the background and context of the pieces that are being played.

I believe that knowing the background of the music can make a huge difference in how much someone enjoys it. When you understand the story and history behind a piece of music, it becomes more than just a series of notes and melodies; it becomes a powerful expression of emotion and meaning. Also knowing the background of the music can help us appreciate and connect with the music on a deeper level, allowing us to use it as a powerful tool for stress relief and relaxation. By actively listening and understanding the expressive qualities of the music, we can harness its potential to enhance our mood and promote emotional wellbeing.",general_qa

Keep in mind that this was a time when smartphones were far from widespread, and being able to check stock prices on a mobile phone was already a very novel thing.

What is the attraction in the United States for the Jeep Wrangler?,,"The Jeep Wrangler represents the current version of the original Jeep Willys platform which was first released in 1940 for the U.S. Army.  The Jeep Wrangler platform first became available in 1987 and has become one of the most recognizable vehicles manufactured today.  The love Wrangler owners have for their vehicles stems from the utilitarian nature of the platform, the ability to remove the top and doors in warmer weather, the wide array of aftermarket modifications available, as well as its extensive off road capabilities directly off the showroom floor. Jeep enthusiasts, also known as “Jeepers,” often wave at each other when passing in opposite directions.  This tradition stemmed from the use of the Willy’s model in the US military where out of reverence and courtesy passing soldiers driving their Jeeps would wave or salute each other depending on rank.  This tradition continues today amongst Wrangler owners and has been affectionately dubbed the “Jeep Wave.”",brainstorming
Describe the sensation of taking a cold shower and explain the rationale for why someone might take one.,,"When you take a shower with very cold water, you throw your body into a temporary state of shock. You feel your skin raise. Your toes may curl a bit. Your eyes may widen. If it is early morning and you're still waking up, you may find that you suddenly feel very alert. 

By leaving a room with a warm and comfortable temperature and entering a space with water produced at a chilly and uncomfortable temperature you actually trick your body. The sudden shift produces alertness that can be beneficial for people who are trying to wake up without caffeine and other stimulants or are otherwise trying to train their bodies to tolerate harsh conditions.",creative_writing

Next we try a vanilla cake with a chai frosting, and I like it a lot more, since I love spice. Although I do worry that the vanilla cake might be a bit plain. A third option is a dark chocolate cake with a cherry and chocolate ganache filling, which is very rich and moist, which I appreciate. Fourth we try a lemon drizzle cake, which is nice but I'm not sure the right choice for the rest of our menu. And for our final flavor we try a matcha cake with white chocolate frosting, which has a very nice cake but I think the frosting is too sweet. Finally, I decide to pick the chocolate and cherry combination because I think it had the best cake and frosting combination.",creative_writing

Write an essay describing why baseball should be considered America's pastime.,,"Baseball is the oldest professional sport in America. It began in the late 1800s. The sport dates back to to the civil war era, which is where it started to become known as America's pastime. It coincides with a plethora of historical and cultural aspects of life in America. While the game has a vast amount of historical significance, it also seems to reflect changes that occur in our society. For example, over the past several decades we have seen a huge influx in players from all over the globe, with greater representation from countries like Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Japan and many others. America has always been considered a land of opportunity and this is evident with baseball. The MLB is the most prestigious league when it comes to baseball and is dream destination for any player. If you are good enough, you are sometime given the opportunity to play here. Recently we have seen a huge increase in the international representation of players in the league. As times have changed and the world has become more global, we also see this transpire in baseball. Baseball is America's pastime because it is a preservation of historical values, but also adapts and reflects current cultural values, which always keeps it relevant.",creative_writing

What is data visualisation in the context of business intelligence?,,"Data visualisation in any context is the art and science of organising data in such a way that makes it easily consumable by a human audience. Specifically, in the context of business intelligence, you are typically presenting facts and insights about a business to stakeholders in order for them to take action and make better decisions to run that business. 

Good data visualisation combines user experience design with an understanding of how people interpret data to provide something intuitive and compelling for the intended audience to use. 

Here are some examples of design and interpretation choices you might make:

In terms of design, many cultures write on a page from top to bottom, left to right. This means that the first place on any visualisation that a person from any of these cultures will look is top left. Consequently, the content you put in the top left space of your dashboard should be a critically important part of the story you are trying to tell. In a culture that writes right to left you might put higher-value content on the right-hand side of the visualisation. 

In terms of in terms interpretation you want to key into things that people are naturally good at interpreting. For example, if you are presenting sales by product category and you have 10 product categories you could choose to leverage a bar chart where the length of the bar represents sales or a pie chart where the angle of the slice represents sales. A bar chart would be a better choice because people find it easy to compare the length of a bar. We cannot distinguish between the sizes of a slice with anywhere near the same level of accuracy. Choosing a pie chart would leave your users spending more time and effort interpreting your data visualisation than if you had chosen a bar chart to present the information to them.",general_qa

Generally, defense mechanisms are human responses responses to anxiety and how the consciousness and unconscious manage the stress of a social situation. Some of the most common defense mechanisms include:

Repression: forcing a feeling from the consciousness to the unconscious because it is seen as socially unacceptable

Regression: falling back into an early state of mental/physical development seen as less demanding and safer

Projection: possessing a feeling that is deemed as socially unacceptable and instead of facing it, that feeling or ""unconscious urge"" is seen in the actions of other people

Reaction formation: acting the opposite way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, ""often exaggerated and obsessive"". For example, if a wife is infatuated with a man who is not her husband, reaction formation may cause her to – rather than cheat – become obsessed with showing her husband signs of love and affection.

Sublimation: seen as the most acceptable of the mechanisms, an expression of anxiety in socially acceptable ways",closed_qa

Overtime you keep changing the shape slightly here and there; sometimes making the structure smaller and sometimes a little bigger. And you are doing all of these from the lego collection in the basket of yours. Cloud computing in a similar way is compute power that you can rent out from a cloud provider who has huge data centers spread across the world (This is the basket).

What is the difference between American Football and European Football?,,"Prior to American Football coming into existence, European Football was played throughout the world as an athletic sport that entailed kicking a round ball into an opponent's goal. European Football is typically played on a grass turf surface called a pitch. European Football was actually first called soccer before its adoption by the entire world and ended up settling on the name football. This is where the common confusion surrounds European Football and American Football. American Football, created much later than European Football, is played with a pig skin with a prolate shape on a grass turf surface, much like European Football. In American Football, instead of using their feet, players use their hands to pass the ball to one another through the air or hand the ball off to one another and attempt to run into the opponent's endzone. When European Football eventually came to the United States, the moniker soccer remained with the sport. This is why European Football is the same as American Soccer and American Football is not the same as European Football.",open_qa

What is a phenotype?,,"In genetics and genomics, the phenotype  is the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism. The term covers the organism's morphology (physical form and structure), its developmental processes, its biochemical and physiological properties, its behavior, and the products of behavior. An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism's genetic code (its genotype) and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting the phenotype. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called polymorphic. A well-documented example of polymorphism is Labrador Retriever coloring; while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black, and brown. Richard Dawkins in 1978 and then again in his 1982 book The Extended Phenotype suggested that one can regard bird nests and other built structures such as caddisfly larva cases and beaver dams as ""extended phenotypes"".

Wilhelm Johannsen proposed the genotype–phenotype distinction in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's hereditary material and what that hereditary material produces. The distinction resembles that proposed by August Weismann (1834–1914), who distinguished between germ plasm (heredity) and somatic cells (the body). More recently, in The Selfish Gene (1976), Dawkins distinguished these concepts as replicators and vehicles.

The genotype–phenotype distinction should not be confused with Francis Crick's central dogma of molecular biology, a statement about the directionality of molecular sequential information flowing from DNA to protein, and not the reverse.",open_qa

How to give a good presentation?,,"Any good presentations should be well-timed. The presenter should make eye contact with the audience. They should also make use of power pauses - count ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5"" - before moving on. It may sound awkward for you but silence can be immensely powerful for audience to absorb the message. Don't be afraid to be yourself on the stage. Be mindful of your body language on the stage. Don't pace like a lion and find your resting pose. The most important thing though, is to practice!

Is karaoke fun?,,"It depends.  Some people like karaoke, and some don't.  You might enjoy karaoke if, for example, you have an outgoing personality, like to sing or perform publicly, or enjoy bonding with others over music.  Others might find karaoke to be loud or may not like listening to amateur performers, who at times can also be intoxicated if performing at a karaoke bar.  In addition, when at a public location that offers karaoke, the songs are selected by the performer, so you cannot predict whether you will enjoy the music selection (unless you may happen to rent a private room where you can select all of the songs yourself, which is offered at certain karaoke institutions).  Interestingly, whether or not you personally would consider yourself to have a good voice does not always determine how much you will enjoy karaoke.",general_qa

What is the best location for a family vacation in western Europe?,,"The best location depends on individual tastes and preferences.  

For a vacation in a city, you can’t beat Paris.  There is a large range of available cuisine, from inexpensive bistros and cafes, to very expensive, Michelin starred restaurants.  It is hard to get a bad meal in Paris.  The sightseeing also is impressive, with modern architecture combined with classic structures, and many museums to fill your days. Getting around Paris is very easy, as it is a very walkable city and also has an efficient and relatively inexpensive public transportation system.  

For a lake vacation, Lake Como is wonderful, and in particular Bellagio, which is widely regarded as the prettiest village in Lake Como.  Getting to Bellagio is fairly easy, as it’s close to Milan.  The food is reasonably priced, although it’s generally northern Italian food (with limited options for other ethnic food).  Transportation around the lake is convenient with an efficient ferry service on Lake Como, although getting into the individual villages can be a bit challenging given the hills (so expect to walk!).  Many villages near Bellagio are also very quaint, and within walking distance – you’ll definitely get good exercise going from village to village.

For a seaside vacation, Dubrovnik is a great choice.  It’s not so convenient to get there from the United States, especially for those in the western United States since there are no direct flights.  However, it’s well worth the trip.  This walled city is jaw dropping beautiful.  The people are among the friendliest in Europe.  The food is fairly inexpensive and delicious, with a lot of seafood options.  And some restaurants are literally perched off of a cliff, so the views are incredible. Croatian dried lemons and oranges are fantastic, and a specialty of the region.  There also is beautiful pottery.",general_qa
What was MarCal's restaurant?,,"MarCal's restaurant was originally started as a small diner in Chilton, WI, by its proprietors, Marty and Margie Salm.  The name ""MarCal's"" was formed by combining part of Marty and Margie's first names with the first name of the banker who was willing to take the risk and loan them the capital to start the business.  It took several years for the business to take hold, and as it gained popularity, MarCal's moved to a larger location in Chilton that also had space for events.  Marty would later partner with his brother, Ed, to start MarCal's Too in Valders, WI. When his son, Dave, finished culinary training, Dave partnered with his sister Nancy to run the Chilton location.  Marty and Margie moved to start another MarCal's diner in the city of Brillion, WI.  The business thrived for many years, with Marty leading operations and being the primary cook, and Margie working as a waitress and running the front of the business, as well as the accounting. Sunday morning breakfasts were always busy, and one item on the menu Marty was particularly proud of was the potato pancakes.  The recipe for these pancakes came from Marty's mother, Eva Salm, who knew a thing or two about feeding a large number of people since she had to keep her family of 15 children fed, as well as their many farm hands.  MarCals restaurants no longer exist, as they were all closed at various times after Marty and Margie's retirement, but many a fond memory of Sunday breakfasts and lunch time buffets still remain.",general_qa

It differs from paddling sports in that rowing oars are attached to the boat using oarlocks, while paddles are not connected to the boat. Rowing is divided into two disciplines: sculling and sweep rowing. In sculling, each rower holds two oars—one in each hand, while in sweep rowing each rower holds one oar with both hands. There are several boat classes in which athletes may compete, ranging from single sculls, occupied by one person, to shells with eight rowers and a coxswain, called eights. There are a wide variety of course types and formats of racing, but most elite and championship level racing is conducted on calm water courses 2 kilometres long with several lanes marked using buoys.",general_qa

The main core architecture of the Transformer model includes: Self-Attention Mechanism, Positional Encoding, Encoder-Decoder Architecture, Multi-Head Attension.
Transformer effectively solves the difficult parallel problem of the previous RNN/LSTM model by using the Attention mechanism. Using Self-Attention solves the problem of limited labeled data in NLP. The sequence information in the input text is preserved through Positional Encoding. And Multi-Head Attention allows Transformer to learn different patterns of training data similar to Channel concept in CNN model.",summarization

what is Financial centre,a financi centr be financi center ae or financi hub i a locat with a concentr of particip in ban asset manag insur or financi market with venu and suppor servic for these activ to take place,"A financial centre (BE), financial center (AE), or financial hub, is a location with a concentration of participants in banking, asset management, insurance or financial markets with venues and supporting services for these activities to take place.[3][4] Participants can include financial intermediaries (such as banks and brokers), institutional investors (such as investment managers, pension funds, insurers, and hedge funds), and issuers (such as companies and governments). Trading activity can take place on venues such as exchanges and involve clearing houses, although many transactions take place over-the-counter (OTC), that is directly between participants. Financial centres usually host companies that offer a wide range of financial services, for example relating to mergers and acquisitions, public offerings, or corporate actions; or which participate in other areas of finance, such as private equity, hedge funds, and reinsurance. Ancillary financial services include rating agencies, as well as provision of related professional services, particularly legal advice and accounting services.[5]

The International Monetary Fund's classes of major financial centres are: International Financial Centres (IFCs), such as New York City,[6] London, and Singapore; Regional Financial Centres (RFCs), such as Shanghai, Shenzhen, Frankfurt, and Sydney; and Offshore Financial Centres (OFCs), such as Cayman Islands, Dublin, and Hong Kong.[a]


The City of London (the ""Square Mile"") is one of the oldest financial centres. London is ranked as one of the largest International Financial Centres in the world.
International Financial Centres, and many Regional Financial Centres, are full–service financial centres with direct access to large capital pools from banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and listed capital markets, and are major global cities. Offshore Financial Centres, and also some Regional Financial Centres, tend to specialise in tax-driven services, such as corporate tax planning tools, tax–neutral vehicles,[b] and shadow banking/securitisation, and can include smaller locations (e.g. Luxembourg), or city-states (e.g. Singapore). The IMF notes an overlap between Regional Financial Centres and Offshore Financial Centres (e.g. Hong Kong and Singapore are both Offshore Financial Centres and Regional Financial Centres). Since 2010, academics consider Offshore Financial Centres synonymous with tax havens.[c]",information_extraction

Most of these children are born to parents who migrated to the USA to work in fields such as Information Technology, Research or white collar jobs that require a good academic qualification. In general, for people to migrate from India to the US one of the main criteria is exceptional academic performance with post graduate university qualifications in addition to being very proficient in English.So, the parents of these children of Indian origin have a strong academic educational background and try to create an environment at home that places great emphasis on academic learning.

SpellBee has become very popular with the events being telecast on TV. The event is becoming more popular among the Indian community in the US as they see Indian kids being successful in the contests and getting national recognition when they perform well in SpellBee. When the Indian parents find that their kids are showing some aptitude in spelling and are capable of putting in the required effort, the parents start motivating the children to start practising for SpellBee contests. 

These children of Indian origin spend significant effort over a period of several months or in some cases even years fine tuning their skills to practise for SpellBee contests. A combination of hard work, the support from the parents and family and the motivation of these children to perform well in SpellBee are all factors contributing to the success of the children of Indian origin in the SpellBee contests in the USA.",open_qa
